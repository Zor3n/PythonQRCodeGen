# PYTHON QR CODE GENERATION

This is a small program for generating QR codes from a link and just a simple practice in python.

Using `pyqrcode` for QR generation and `pypng` for visualizing the image in .png format once the program ends.

In this few lines of code you can either generate the code automatically, putting the link and the image name in the code, or manually, asking for the link and image name to an user.
